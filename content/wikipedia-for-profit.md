Should it be illegal to own a software platform?
- Ownership of software platforms gives the owner a ton of power.
  They can do all sorts of monopolistic, anti-competitive things.
- How do you run a software platform then?
  - You have a non-profit run it.
- Article title: what if Wikipedia was a for-profit company?
- Another angle is centralized vs federated vs decentralized.
  - Federated and decentralized services are less efficient.
    They have one big advantage: they put more control into the
    hands of the user. In a federated service, users can pick up
    and go to another service provider. In a decentralized service,
    users never depend on a service provider at all. But this is
    a red herring. The freedom this gives users is a technical
    solution to a political/organizational problem. If your service
    exploits users or doesn't meet their needs, it is almost never
    a technical problem. If it is a technical problem, it is probably
    a technical problem that exists because there is a people problem
    with the people who make the service work.
- Software is conducive to being run by non-profits, because it is
  intangible: it is easy for a few people to provide a service to
  huge numbers of people.
- Can take the angle of the 4 S's of intangible assets.
  - Scalable: software is conducive to being run by non-profits, because
    it is easy for a few people to provide a service to huge numbers of people.
  - Sunk cost: ??
  - Spillover: you don't have to worry about guarding your IP when all you
    are worried about is running your service.
  - Synergies: non-profits have no incentive to lock users in or to introduce
    new products, so there is no benefit here.
